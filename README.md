# Artemis-Financial-Project-TwoCS-305
**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**
Artemis Financial is a Financial Institution, who had the need for a secure system in which to encrypt their information. This was accomplished using SHA-256 and AES-256.
**What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?**
As someone who has owned a buisness in the past, I have an inside view into the needs of a buisness owner, so I can have a semi-formed idea of the needs they may have. Coding securely ensures that the system I design for clients will have little to no vulnerabilities if possible. When a client, like in this situation, is a financial institution, the data of their clients becomes a top priority in keeping secure. Having little to no vulnerabilities ensures no data theft happens.
**What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?**
I found running through command lines in command prompt a bit of a challenge as it's something I've not had much experience with. To ensure I did everything correctly I had some outside help to ensure that I was pushed in the right direction a few times, once I was down however the process was easily understood.
**How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?**
While working through each layer, I tried to break down their needs and wants, and then find ways to meet each of those demands by ensuring proper security layers, like upgrading from HTTP to HTTPS.
**How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
Utilizing Spring Boot and Maven I checked the dependancies before and after code refcator, ensuring no new vulnerabilites were introduced into the system.
**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
Maven, Spring Boot, Command Prompt maastery.
**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?**
My ability to analyze a clients needs and develop a secure system to meet those needs.
